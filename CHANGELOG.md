## v0.2.0
### Added
- Added support for the Bevy API for Rhai
- Foundations laid for proxy macro for Rhai
- Added `game_of_life` and `bevy_api` examples for Rhai
- Added more hooks for APIProviders. `entity` and `world` constants are now set by API providers and hence you must register the `BevyAPIProvider` for your scripting language to access those.
